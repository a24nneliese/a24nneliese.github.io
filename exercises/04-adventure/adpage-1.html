        <h1>Dragonstone</h1>
        <p>
            Dragonstone is an ancient, volcanic stronghold by the sea, tied to
            Daenerys as a place of inheritance and identity. It represents her 
            claim, her roots, and the beginning of her rise—more symbol than 
            battleground, heavy with history and ambition. Daenerys stands for 
            justice and liberty. She believes she is the rightful heir to the 
            Iron throne due to her Dragon lineage.
        </p>
        <h2>You must choose to kneel to Queen Daenerys or betray her.</h2>
