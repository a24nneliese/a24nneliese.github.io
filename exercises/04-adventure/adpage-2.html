        <p>
            King’s Landing is the heart of the realm, a city of power, politics,
            and peril. It is closely tied to Cersei, whose ambition, cunning, 
            and fierce will shape much of what occurs there. Her character is 
            defined by relentless determination, a thirst for control, and a 
            willingness to do whatever it takes to protect her family and her 
            position, making her both formidable and feared.

        </p>
        <h2>You must choose to kneel to Queen Cersei or betray her.</h2>
