                        Known for his strong sense of honor, loyalty, and 
                        courage. He is humble and often puts duty above 
                        personal desire. Jon values fairness and justice, 
                        even when it costs him personally. Though quiet and 
                        serious, he is compassionate and willing to sacrifice 
                        himself to protect others.

                        Intelligent, resilient, and patient. She grows from 
                        being naive and idealistic into a strong, strategic, 
                        and emotionally tough leader. Sansa learns from 
                        hardship, becoming cautious, wise, and determined to 
                        protect her family and her people.

                        Quiet, thoughtful, and deeply intuitive. After his 
                        transformation into the Three-Eyed Raven, he becomes 
                        wise, calm, and detached, guided by knowledge rather 
                        than emotion. Bran values understanding and long-term 
                        vision over personal ambition.
