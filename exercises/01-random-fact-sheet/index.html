    Anneliese's Pick Facts
</h2>
<h4> Leonardo da Vinci <sup>(<i>Art </i>)</sup> </h4>
<p>
<b> 1. </b>Leonardo da Vinci secretly dissected over 30 human bodies,<br></br> 
often at night, to understand anatomy for his art, creating remarkably<br></br>
 detailed drawings of muscles, bones, and organs, revealing a mechanical <br></br>
 view of the body and leading to breakthroughs like understanding the heart's <br></br>
 valves, though his findings weren't published for centuries, remaining a secret <br></br>
 masterpiece of Renaissance science. 
</p>
<h4> Phineas Gage <sup>(<i>Psychology </i>)</sup> </h4>
<p>
    <b> 2. </b> Phineas Gage, a 19th-century railroad worker, survived a horrific <br></br>
    accident where a 13-pound iron rod shot through his head, lodging <br></br>in his frontal lobe, yet remained conscious, walking and talking shortly <br></br>
    after, becoming a landmark case showing the brain's role in personality,<br></br> though reports of his "changed" personality are often exaggerated; <br></br>
    he eventually worked as a stagecoach driver in Chile, demonstrating <br></br>neuroplasticity before dying years later from epileptic seizures, his skull <br></br>
    and the rod preserved as scientific artifacts.
